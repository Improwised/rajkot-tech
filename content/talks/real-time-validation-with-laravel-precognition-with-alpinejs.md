Validations are essential in web development to ensure that the data users enter is correct and secure. Client-side validation offers quick feedback to users, making it easy to catch errors right away. However, it's not enough on its own, as it can be bypassed. Server-side validation is necessary because it checks data more thoroughly and securely on the server. Using both types of validation together ensures that data is accurate and safe.

Laravel Precognition is a tool that makes it easier to do real-time validations by checking data directly on the server as you type. In this talk, we'll show you why traditional validation methods fall short and how Laravel Precognition can help. We'll provide a demo without Precognition to highlight the challenges, and then a demo with it to show how it works with Laravel and AlpineJS. By the end, you'll see how Laravel Precognition can improve your validation process and enhance user experience. Thank you!
