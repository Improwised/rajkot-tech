This hands-on workshop is designed to cover the basics of Docker and Containers, and targeted towards Web Developers. While having web development experience will make it easy for you to understand and pick up the things we are going to cover, beginners are also welcome. We will help you individually in case you're stuck.



You will learn:



* What is Docker, and how it helps make development and deployment easier

* How Docker containers work

* How to run third-party software easily through Docker

* How to package your application in Docker containers and run it



Prerequisites

-------------



* A Laptop Computer with Linux/Mac OS X/Windows with working WiFi

* An SSH Client (PuTTY for Windows. Linux and Mac has it preinstalled)

* Note: Docker Installation is not required on your local machine because we're going to be doing this workshop on remote computers.
