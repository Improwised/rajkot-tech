Introducing the first VueJs Meetup in Rajkot.



You should attend if:

- You're new to frontend / frameworks, e.g.
- Backend engineers
- Folks working with jQuery
- Folks working on Angular / React but are keen to explore the buzz around Vue!
- You're about to start a new project, e.g.
  Working in a start-up where you want to quickly experiment with things (Vue is an easy-to-pick frontend framework with documented ways of doing common things)
- Working in a large company and are evaluating options
- You're already working on Vue and want to connect with like-minded people
